This Java code implements a solution to the Shamir's Secret Sharing problem, specifically finding the constant term (secret) of a polynomial given its roots. The code uses Lagrange interpolation to reconstruct the polynomial and then evaluates it at x = 0 to obtain the constant term.

Instructions:

Create a new Java file: Save the code in a Java file with a .java extension, such as ShamirSecretSharing.java.

Compile the code: Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Java file is saved, and compile the code using the following command:

Bash
javac ShamirSecretSharing.java
Use code with caution.

Run the code: Execute the compiled Java class using the following command:

Bash
java ShamirSecretSharing
Use code with caution.

This will run the code, and the output will display the secret for each test case.

Additional Notes:

Make sure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
If you encounter any compilation errors, double-check the code for syntax mistakes or missing imports.
You can provide the test cases as input to the code when running it. The code will read the input from the standard input stream.
Example:

If you have a file named input.txt containing the test cases, you can run the code like this:

Bash
java ShamirSecretSharing < input.txt
Use code with caution.

This will redirect the contents of input.txt as input to the code.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run the Java code and obtain the desired output for your test cases.
